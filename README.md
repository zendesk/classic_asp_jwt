<%
Dim sKey, dAttributes, sToken, decodedPayload, isValidJWT

sKey = "Shared Secret"
Set dAttributes=Server.CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")

' The UniqueString and SecsSinceEpoch functions are provided by this implementation
dAttributes.Add "jti", UniqueString
dAttributes.Add "iat", SecsSinceEpoch
dAttributes.Add "name", "Roger"
dAttributes.Add "email", "roger@example.com"

sToken = JWTEncode(dAttributes, sKey)

' Decode JWT token string and get payload. (WARNING : Not verify)
decodedPayload = JWTDecode(sToken)

' Verify JWT String. (Returns Boolean)
isValidJWT = JWTVerify(sToken, sKey)
%>
```
